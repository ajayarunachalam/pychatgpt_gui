About pyChatGPT GUI
===================

`pyChatGPT_GUI` is a simple, ease-to-use Python GUI Wrapper built for unleashing the power of GPT. `pyChatGPT_GUI` provides an easy web interface to access the large language models (llm's) with several built-in application utilities for direct use. One can leverage ChatGPT, AutoGPT, LLaMa, GPT-J, and GPT4All models with pre-trained inferences and for your own data while democratizing the complex workflows. It provides a very `simple`, `easy-to-use` and `low-code` solution.    

`pyChatGPT_GUI` is concieved, designed and developed by `Ajay Arunachalam` - https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajay-ph-d-4744581a/

Please Note:- This work was just started, and by large still work in progress.


The application provides the following services (not limited too):-
===================================================================

- **Get `ChatGPT` inferences on your custom data**

- **Sentiment Analyzer with `ChatGPT`**

- **ChatGPT-based Voice Assistant Bot** 

- **Get `Auto-GPT` inferences for your requirement**

- **Conversational Retrieval Question & Answer (QA) Chain Bot**

- **Using open-source `GPT4` large language models based on `LLaMa` and `GPT-J`**

- **Get `GPT4All` models inferences**

- **Predict label of your inputted text from the predefined tags based on `ChatGPT`**


Who can try pychatgpt_ui?

Usage Steps
===========
Step 1) Create a virtual environment

.. code:: bash
	
	py -3 -m venv <your_env_name>
	cd <your_env_name>/Scripts/activate
	
	**or**
	
	conda create -n <your_env_name> python=3.x (or 3.x)
	source activate <your_env_name>

Step 2) Create the clone of the repository in your created virtual environment

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/ajayarunachalam/pychatgpt_gui
    $ cd pychatgpt_gui
	$ sudo bash setup.sh

    **or**

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/ajayarunachalam/pychatgpt_gui
    $ cd pychatgpt_gui
    $ sudo bash setup.sh or python setup.py install
	
	**or**
	
.. code:: bash
	>>> git clone https://github.com/ajayarunachalam/pychatgpt_gui
	>>> cd pychatgpt_gui
	>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
	
Step 3) Setup the environment configuration for using OpenAI through API. Enter your OpenAI api key in the "api_key.json" file. Note:- Please replace the null string with your key. Check this link on how to get an OpenAI API key - https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/

Step 4) Download the GPT4All model from http://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-l13b-snoozy.bin and place it under the models/ folder. Alternatively, you can also use GPT4All-J model which can be downloaded from here - https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin and similarly place it under the models/ folder in the root directory. 

Step 5) Add your own set of documents to train the chatGPT AI bot under the docs/ folder. You could use multiple text files, Scanned files, PDF files, etc. Note:- If you have a large table in Excel, you can import it as a CSV or PDF file and then add it to the "docs" folder. 

Step 6) Add your own custom documents to train the Q&A chatbot with Conversational Retrieval Chain under the qa_docs/ folder. You can use any of the following file types: text files, pdf files, docx files, and log files

Step 7) Launch the APP

- **Linux users navigate within the cloned folder and type in "sudo bash run_app_linux.sh" in the terminal**

- **Windows users within the cloned folder just simply double-click the "run_app_windows.bat" file. Note:- Open the file with an Editor and replace with your virtual directory path within the file**

The APP will launch with a URL as seen below.
